## [1.2.4](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/tree/1.2.4) (2022-09-21)
### Updated
- For Ubuntu & Debian droplets, the update script will now also check for newer keyring package as well to ensure a fast
and smooth GPG key rotation

### Related PRs
- update.sh check for newer keyring packages [\#60](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/pull/60)

## [1.2.3](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/tree/1.2.3) (2022-06-16)
### Updated
- Droplet Agent now supports dynamically turning the managed ssh keys feature on and off. If the metadata of the droplet
suggests that the droplet has the managed ssh keys feature turned on, droplet-agent will attempt to manage the keys that 
are configured through DigitalOcean platform.
- NOTES: Only keys configured through DigitalOcean platform will be managed by the droplet-agent. Such keys will be 
marked in the authorized_keys file and should not be manually modified.

### Related PRs
- Support dynamically enabling and disabling managed keys feature [\#58](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/pull/58)

## [1.2.2](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/tree/1.2.2) (2022-05-31)
### Updated
- Starting from [1.2.0](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/tree/1.2.0), agent supports managing ssh keys for
the customers by attempting to sync the keys presented in the droplet's metadata to the droplet. This prevents customers 
from being able to remove the keys from the droplet. Therefore, the feature is turned off for now. 

### Related PRs
- Stop managing droplet ssh keys [\#57](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/pull/57)

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/tree/1.2.1) (2022-03-28)
### Updated
- Update ssh keys will ignore invalid keys.
- We noticed that some keys configured for a droplet may become deprecated by OpenSSH, which causes validation of those keys to fail.
- Now, instead of failing at the first invalid SSH key, we continue processing in case there are valid SSH keys in the input list.
- This behavior is accomplished by skipping invalid keys, and only processing the valid keys.

### Bug fixed
- Fixed a bug that can unexpectedly extend the expiry time of a temporary ssh key

### Related PRs
- Skip invalid keys [\#49](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/pull/49)
- Should not change expired time if key unchanged [\#50](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/pull/50)

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/tree/1.2.0) (2022-02-03)
### Updated
- Add support for managing SSH Keys on a droplet. If a droplet is configured with one or more SSH Keys through 
DigitalOcean, either during droplet creation or added/removed via DigitalOcean APIs, such changes can now be 
synchronized to the droplet and the keys can be dynamically installed/uninstalled.
- Don't use syslog when systemd is supported

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/tree/1.1.1) (2021-11-24)
### Updated
- Refactored the update script to consume less CPU when checking for newer version.

### Related PRs
- refactor update.sh: light-weight check version [\#43](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/pull/43) ([house-lee](https://github.com/house-lee))

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/digitalocean/droplet-agent/tree/1.1.0) (2021-10-28)
### Added
- Support for custom sshd port. If the sshd service is running on a port different from the default one (22), the agent 
will try to fetch the target port by parsing the `sshd_config`. The port number can also be specified via the 
command line argument `sshd_port` when launching the agent.
